# Repository Folder

This folder contains the data access layer of the application. It abstracts the logic for interacting with various data sources such as APIs, databases, or any other storage mechanisms.

## Purpose

- To encapsulate data access logic.
- To provide a clear separation between data fetching and business logic.
- To ensure consistency in data retrieval and manipulation across the application.

## Structure

Typically, this folder will have files and subfolders for different entities or data sources. For example:

- `userRepository.ts`: Handles data operations related to users.
- `productRepository.ts`: Manages data operations related to products.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { getUserById, createUser } from './userRepository';

// Fetch a user by ID
const user = await getUserById('123');

// Create a new user
const newUser = await createUser({ name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com' });
