# Libs Folder

This folder contains custom libraries and modules that provide more complex or specific functionality. These libraries can be used throughout the application and often encapsulate intricate logic or external integrations.

## Purpose

- To modularize complex functionality.
- To encapsulate logic that interacts with external systems or services.
- To provide reusable components that can be leveraged across the application.

## Structure

Typically, this folder will have files and subfolders for different libraries or services. For example:

- `authLib.ts`: Functions and classes for handling user authentication.
- `configLib.ts`: Utilities for managing configuration settings.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { authenticateUser, getAuthToken } from './authLib';

// Authenticate a user
const isAuthenticated = await authenticateUser('username', 'password');

// Get authentication token
const token = getAuthToken();
